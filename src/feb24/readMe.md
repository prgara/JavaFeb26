to exit option you have to repeatedly show the menu to the user.

which loop -> do while
if else vs switch ?


- Take user input for 10 transactions,
if user enters 0 then skip that txs
if user enters less than 0 then stop taking inputs
sum all the valid transactions

167

456
87
78
78

Number game -> you can a random num and then ask user to guess the num. give 3 attempts to user to guess else 
say you lost the game
