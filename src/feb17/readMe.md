- Non-primitive -> user defined

- Arithmetic -> + - / * % ++ --
- Assignment -> = += -= *
- Comparison -> < > >= <= == !=
- Logical -> && || !

Go to walmart or buy milk  Or


 # Truth Table

And -> both conditions should be true to have true as result
Cond-1         Cond-2               Result
  T              T                    T
  T              F                    F
  F              T                    F
  F              F                    F


OR -> One condition should be true
Cond-1         Cond-2                Result
T              T                       T
T              F                       T
F              T                       T
F              F                       F


Not -> if true then false  and vice versa
 T -> F
 F -> T


# Decision-making

if it rains outside I will take umbrella.
If it is sunny outside I will put shades/sunglasses.


if statement

if(condition) {statement}


if(rain == true) {sout}

if else statement
if(isRaining) {Umbrella} else {Shades}

if else-if


WAP to check whether a give num is odd or even using if else ?


nested if-else



# Scanner 
It is a class which is used to get user input
First we have to create an object and then with that object we will get user input



WAP to check whether a give num is positive or negative or zero by taking user input.
